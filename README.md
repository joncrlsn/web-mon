# web-mon
A small web application monitor written in GoLang (AKA Go).  This is still in progress.  This was created for monitoring the HTTP response times on a Java application server and take thread dumps when the response times are too slow, but feel free to fork it to work for your project, or submit a pull request with generally useful changes.  

### version 0.1

### todo
* Externalize the hard-coded variables in main.go to a config file
* Add the normal flags (--help, --version, --verbose, etc)
